Wolfram cellular automata EXE Version

To make it easier for users to run the Python scripts without having to have Python installed, I have added a .rar file containing the scripts as .exe files.

What was added:
A .rar archive containing the Python scripts compiled in .exe format.

How to use it:
- Download the .rar file from the repository.
- Unzip the contents of the .rar file into a folder of your choice.
- Execute the .exe file to run the script without having to install Python.

Note: The .exe version is provided for ease of use and should work on any Windows system without additional dependencies.

If you encounter any problems or have any questions, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.
